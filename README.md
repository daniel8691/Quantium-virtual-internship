# Trial_store_analysis

Check out my full analysis [here](https://quantium-virtual-internship.herokuapp.com/module1) on Heroku!

Quantium has a partnership with a large supermarket brand for the past few years who provides transactional and customer data. Supermarkets regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices, and promotions. This is to satisfy the customer's changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalize on new opportunities.

My task as a data analyst is to evaluate and analyze the performance of any changes that the client has made and recommend whether the change has been successful.
